This script essentially automates the process of searching Google for a list of keywords, filtering the results to include only those containing "geeksforgeeks", and saving the filtered results to a text file.

Here's a Python script that utilizes the googlesearch library to search for a keyword on Google and saves the results in a text file along with the corresponding keyword, Here's a breakdown of the provided code:
<ul>

<li>Importing Libraries: The code imports the search function from the googlesearch module, allowing the script to perform Google searches programmatically.</li>

<li>Defining the Function: A function named search_and_save is defined. It takes two parameters: keyword_list, which is a list of keywords to search, and output_file, the name of the file to save the search results.</li>

<li>Opening Output File: The script opens the output file in write mode ('w'). The with statement ensures proper file handling, automatically closing the file after the block of code is executed.</li>

<li>Looping Through Keywords: The script iterates through each keyword in the keyword_list.</li>

<li>Writing Keyword Header: It writes a header indicating the keyword being searched to the output file.</li>

<li>Performing Google Search: The script calls the search function with the current keyword, specifying parameters for the number of results to retrieve, when to stop, and the pause between requests.</li>

<li>Looping Through Search Results: It iterates over each search result, using enumerate to get the index of the result.</li>

<li>Writing Search Results to File: If the search result contains "geeksforgeeks", it writes the result to the output file along with its index.</li>

<li>Writing Blank Line: It writes a blank line to separate the search results for different keywords.</li>

<li>Main Function: The code checks if the script is being executed as the main program.</li>

<li>Keyword List and Output File: It defines the list of keywords to search (keywords) and the name of the output file (output_filename).</li>

<li>Calling the Function: It calls the search_and_save function with the provided keywords list and output_filename.</li>

<li>Print Statement: It prints a message indicating that the search results have been saved successfully.</li>

</ul>
